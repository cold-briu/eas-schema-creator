# Intro

This is book is meant to keep track of the design and implementation process of a simplified and intuitive all in one tool for `EAS`. 


## Goals

- Provide a intuitive way to create onchain `Attestations schemas` for `EAS`.
- Abstract the gas data types and gas optimization away from the user. 
- Create templates and workflows for specific use cases.
- Provide a intuitive interface to interact with specific `EAS` use cases, such as governance, events, etc.
